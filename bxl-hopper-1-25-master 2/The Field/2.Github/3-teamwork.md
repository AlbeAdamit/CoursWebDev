# Working in team

The goal of this exercise is a real life example of the first steps needed to create a project. This is usually done in several days, you'll have to do it in half a day. 

Type of challenge: **consolidation**  
Duration: **half a day**  
Team challenge: **team**

## Learning objectives
At the end of this challenge you'll get a solid grasp of project management. You will have to deal with clients with unclear expectations, it is time to convert ideas into real tasks.

## The mission
You've been contacted by a shady billionaire to build an app called `Il fait beau l√† haut` (IFBLH, in short). The concept is a bit vague. Basically an user (the request user) can use the app to contact any of the other users (the target user) of the IFBLH network, and have a preview of the weather there using the phone camera. It can be used on mobile or web browser. You can pick a location from a map or from a contact-list. You can save the location of your favorite weather spots to access them at any time, but only if the target user has granted the request user access to their phone.

Ideally you will track the different steps of the project on a kanban board (using trello).

The billionaire has the money, you have the skills. 
* Create ONE repository for the team called `IFBLH`
* Create a directory (folder) named `screens` that should contain
  * A markdown file for each screen, containing its description (what can you do on that part of the app), with a mockup image
  * The different image 
* At the root of the repository create a readme file containing
  * A description of the project and the approach you want to take
  * A table describing the team and their roles
  * A link to the the screen and their description
  * __bonus__  A link to the trello kanban board (if you used one)
