# Git exploration (part 1)

Git is powerful tool to share and host your code online. We're going to explore the tool step by step, and see how it relates to GitHub.

Type of challenge: **learning**  
Duration: **1h min**  
Team challenge: **solo**

## Learning objectives
At the end of this challenge you should be able to:
* Create a local git repository
* Create a remote repository on GitHub
* Read and update your code

## The mission
* On Github create a new **private** repository (the name does not really matter)
* Using the terminal go to the directory you created in the previous lesson and initialise a new repository using `git init`
* Upload your local repository to the one you created on GitHub
* You can now brag on your newly created repository to your colleagues. Check what is displayed, what you cando, ... it is the begining of a long journey.

## Bonus
* Explore your first git commands
* Update the `readme.md` file using the git system (hint: `add`, `commit`, `push`)

## Requirements
This briefing assumes that you know how to:
* Use the terminal
* Use markdown
* Have git installed

## Ressources
The git documentation is awful, but there are great tutorials online. Ask for help and share with the others. Be strong.
