> Cookie Clicker is an incremental game created by French programmer Julien "Orteil" Thiennot in 2013. The user initially clicks on a big cookie on the screen, earning a single cookie per click. They can then spend their earned cookies upon purchasing assets such as "cursors" and other "buildings" that automatically produce cookies. Upgrades are also available and can improve the efficiency of clicks and buildings, among many other mechanics that allow the user to earn cookies in different ways. 

## Learning objectives

- Get to know the react.js environment

This challenge will have you create a cookie clicker using React. Follow the instructions to complete the challenge, to get some ideas check the examples in the resources section.

- You start the game with a "cookie" to click on. Clicking on it will increase your score by one
- Once you reach a certain amount of cookie (eg.: 10). You can buy your first building. Buildings allow you to generate cookie automatically
- The more you buy a certain type of building, the more it becomes expensive.
- You gradually unlock new building as your cookie production grows.
- Want to go further ? 
    - Find a way to save/export a running game
    - Achievements?
