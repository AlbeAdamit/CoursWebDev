# How to be productive at home 

## 1/ Get ready first thing in the morning

It means maybe taking a shower, getting dressed and getting breakfast. 
It sets your mind on working. Staying in your pyjamas won't do you any favor. You might look yourself in a mirror and think you're not someone with the best capacities. Getting ready will certainly help you getting out of a demotivation rut.   
  

## 2/Make your schedule work for you

We're all different. I like working in the morning and relax in the afternoon. When you don't know your capacities, you might think you're not effective when in fact, you just need to think thouroughly to what's better for you. 
You can check the Pomodoro technique. It's something that some people find helpful. It's an alarm clock that helps you sequence your work periods. When your brain gets tired, it's better to do shorter bursts of work and longer pauses. 
Be aware of the Parkinson's law too. It says that no matter the time given to accomplish something, you will take the entirety of it. If you've been given 2 hours to do a project, you will do in 2 hours. 

## 3/ Put your notifications on mute

You can put your phone on airplane mode, silence mode. You can even download apps that help you to focus by "punishing" you if you go on your phone. The best app I know is called **Forest app**. 

## 4/Take a break for your eyes

That tip is actually important for your eyesight. Staring at a screen all day long isn't very healthy. You can try the app **Break for Eyes**. There's a rule easy to retain, it's called the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes, look something 20 meters away during 20 seconds. This forces your eyes to work and not get used to only see things close from you. It's important too because we tend to forget to blink when watching our screens. 


## 5/ Have a designated space work 

The best kind of space would be a minimalistic and clean space. Your digital desktop should be organized too. Everyone knows how easy it is to get distracted when there's information everywhere around you. 
Physical clutter can become a mental load so it should not be overlooked. 

## 6/ Have hobbies outside of work / Relax 

Humans in general work in 2 phases: work and break. An obvious example of this is that you wake up every morning and at night you basically go to sleep. At work, it's the same principle. 

Sometimes, you just need to stop thinking about work and find something else to do. Be reassured, you don't need to be good at painting to paint. If it's an activity that relaxes you, then do so. It could be dancing, singing, cooking or all three at once. 

## 7/ Have a good sleeping routine 

Because who isn't more productive after a good night of rest. It's the kind of information we all know but we don't do. Having fun is great but sleeping is greater (sometimes).

In your **Iphone**'s alarm clocks, you can find a setting that permits you to set alarms to go to sleep and wake up at the same time every day. **Rise Science** is another app that you should test out. 

## 8/ To do lists 

To do lists are very handy when it comes to productivity. You don't have to be Carol the american stay-at-home mom to like making to do lists. They're very practical to help you focus on one thing at the time. You can either write your priorities for the day or break each priority into mini goals. The satisfaction when you cross something you've done is endless. 

Writing the things you have to do outside of work is a great thing to. It takes out the mental load off your brain and make you more concentrated on your work.

## 9/ Sport (you knew it was coming)

30 minutes of soft physical activity per day is what the health organization recommends. You only need to adapt that to you. Taking your bicycle to le bois de la cambre or just do a walk with your friends/SO outside (since we're confined, don't forget to wear your mask, the fine is way too pricey anyway)

If you don't like to go out, you can workout at home. **Youtube** for this is LITTERALLY YOUR BEST FRIEND. Stretching is another way to workout. 

## 10/ Listen to music - or not

If you didn't know, listening to music can help you concentrate more. You just have to find what suits your boat. Some people like to have white noise in the background. If that's your case, try **Noisli**. 

If you're more like me, putting on jazz music or classical music is what helps me the most. The only problem is when you know the music too well, you'll start thinking you're the guitarist in the band and that's not what we want. 

There are other types of people, the ones that can concentrate when looping over and over the same song. It seems that it helps to concentrate as you don't have to think about the newness of the song.
